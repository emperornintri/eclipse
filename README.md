Welcome to our first project of many. This repository contains our custom implementation of a MNIST classifier using the LeNet-5 architecture. The entire system has been built from absolute scratch using C without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional and efficient MNIST digit classifier using the LeNet-5 architecture. The project is implemented entirely in C, with no external dependencies, ensuring maximum control over every aspect of the computation and system performance.

## Key Features

- Implemented from Scratch: No external machine learning libraries or frameworks. Everything, including the neural network operations, is written from scratch.

- LeNet-5 Architecture: The classifier follows the LeNet-5 architecture, one of the foundational convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.

- MNIST Dataset: The model is trained and tested on the classic MNIST handwritten digit dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9.

- C Language: All of the code is written in pure C to maximize performance and control over the system.

- For ease of use, everything is build and run inside a container.
